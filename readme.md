# 1. Introduction to SQL

`SQL` **is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases**.

What is SQL?

- `SQL stands for Structured Query Language`
- `SQL lets you access and manipulate databases`
- SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

What can SQL do?

- SQL can execute queries against a database
- SQL can retrieve data from a database
- SQL can insert records in a database
- SQL can update records in a database
- SQL can delete records from a database
- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

`SQL` is a `Standard` - BUT although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `WHERE`) in a similar manner.

`RDBMS` is a `Relational Database Management System`.

The data in a `RDBMS` is stored in database objects called `TABLES`.

A `TABLE` is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

Every `TABLE` is broken up into smaller entities called `FIELDS`.

A `FIELD` is a `COLUMN` in a `TABLE` that is designed to maintain specific information about every `RECORD` in the table.

A `RECORD`, also called a `ROW`, is each individual `ENTRY` that exists in a table.

A `RECORD` is a horizontal `ENTITY` in a `TABLE`.

A `COLUMN` is a vertical `ENTITY` in a `TABLE` that contains all information associated with a specific `FIELD` in a `TABLE`.

# 2. SQL Syntax

A database most often contains one or more `TABLES`.
Each `TABLE` is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders").
`TABLES` contain `RECORDS` (`ROWS`) with data.

The table above contains five `RECORDS` (one for each customer) and seven `COLUMNS` (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, and Country).

SQL Statements

Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL STATEMENTS.

The following SQL STATEMENT selects all the records in the "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

Keep in Mind That...

- SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: `select` is the same as `SELECT`
- We will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.

Semicolon after SQL Statements?

Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

- Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.
- We will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands

- `SELECT` - extracts data from a database
- `UPDATE` - updates data in a database
- `DELETE` - deletes data from a database
- `INSERT INTO` - inserts new data into a database
- `CREATE DATABASE` - creates a new database
- `ALTER DATABASE` - modifies a database
- `CREATE TABLE` - creates a new table
- `ALTER TABLE` - modifies a table
- `DROP TABLE` - deletes a table
- `CREATE INDEX` - creates an index (search key)
- `DROP INDEX` - deletes an index

# 3. SQL `SELECT` Statement

The `SELECT` statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

## `SELECT` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

## `SELECT` Column Example

The following SQL statement **selects the "CustomerName" and "City" columns from the "Customers" table**:

```sql
SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;
```

## `SELECT *` Example

The following SQL statement **selects all the columns from the "Customers" table**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

# 4. SQL `SELECT DISTINCT` Statement

The `SELECT DISTINCT` **statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.**

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and **sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values**.

## `SELECT DISTINCT` Syntax

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

## `SELECT` Example Without `DISTINCT`

The following SQL statement **selects all (including the duplicates) values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table**:

```sql
SELECT Country FROM Customers;
```

## `SELECT DISTINCT` Examples

The following SQL statement **selects only the DISTINCT values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table**:

Example

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
```

The following SQL statement **lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries**:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
```

# 5. SQL `WHERE` Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.

It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

## `WHERE` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Note: The `WHERE` clause is not only used in `SELECT` statements, it is also used in `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.!

## `WHERE` Clause Example

The following SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';
```

## Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields

**SQL requires single quotes around text values** (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

However,** numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;
```

## **Operators** in The `WHERE` Clause

The following operators can be used in the `WHERE` clause:

`=` **Equal**

`>` **Greater than**

`<` **Less than**

`>=` **Greater than or equal**

`<=` **Less than or equal**

`<>` **Not equal. In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as** `!=`

`BETWEEN` **Between a certain range**

`LIKE` **Search for a pattern**

`IN` **To specify multiple possible values for a column**

# 5. SQL `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` Operators

The `WHERE` clause can be combined with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators.

The `AND` and `OR` operators are **used to filter records based on more than one condition**.

- **The `AND` operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by `AND` are `TRUE`**.
- **The `OR` operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by `OR` is `TRUE`**.
- **The `NOT` operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.**

## `AND` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
```

## `OR` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
```

## `NOT` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
```

## `AND` Example

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city is "Berlin":

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';
```

## `OR` Example

The following SQL statement **selects all fields from "Customers" where city is "Berlin" `OR` "M端nchen"**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='M端nchen';
```

The following SQL statement **selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" `OR` "Spain"**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' OR Country='Spain';
NOT Example
```

The following SQL statement **selects all fields from "Customers" where country is `NOT` "Germany"**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany';
```

## Combining `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`

You can also combine the `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` operators.

The following SQL statement **selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" `AND` city must be "Berlin" `OR` "M端nchen" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions)**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='M端nchen');
```

The following SQL statement **selects all fields from "Customers" where country is `NOT` "Germany" and `NOT` "USA"**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';
```

# 5. SQL `ORDER BY` Keyword

**The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.**

- **The `ORDER BY` keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default.**
- **To sort the records in descending order, use the `DESC` keyword.**

## `ORDER BY` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```

## `ORDER BY` Example

The following SQL statement **selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" column**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country;
```

## `ORDER BY` DESC Example

The following SQL statement **selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted DESCENDING by the "Country" column**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country DESC;
```

## `ORDER BY` Several Columns Example

The following SQL statement **selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column**. `This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;
```

## `ORDER BY` Several Columns Example 2

The following SQL statement **selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted ascending by the "Country" and descending by the "CustomerName" column**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
```

# 6. SQL `INSERT INTO` Statement

**The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert new records in a table.**

## `INSERT INTO` Syntax

**It is possible to write the `INSERT INTO` statement in two ways:**

1. **Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted**:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

2. **If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.** Here, the `INSERT INTO` syntax would be as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

## `INSERT INTO` Example

The following SQL statement **inserts a new record in the "Customers" table**:

Formt of Table:
CustomerId, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country

```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');
```

Did you notice that we did not insert any number into the CustomerID field?
The CustomerID column is an `auto-increment field` **and will be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into the table**.

## Insert Data Only in Specified Columns

**It is also possible to only insert data in specific columns.**
**If you do not give the other fields a value their value will be `null`.**

The following SQL statement will **insert a new record, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", and "Country" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically)**:

```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');
```

# 7. SQL `NULL` Values

What is a `NULL` Value?

**A field with a `NULL` value is a field with no value.**

**If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a `NULL` value.**

**Note: A `NULL` value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a `NULL` value is one that has been left blank during record creation!**

## How to Test for `NULL` Values?

**It is not possible to test for `NULL` values with comparison operators**, such as `=`, `<`, or `<>`.

We will have to _use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators_ instead.

## `IS NULL` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```

## `IS NOT NULL` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

## The `IS NULL` Operator

**The `IS NULL` operator is used to test for empty values (`NULL` values)**.

**The following SQL lists all customers with a `NULL` value in the "Address" field**:

```sql
Get your own SQL Server
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NULL;
```

Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.

## The `IS NOT NULL` Operator

**The `IS NOT NULL` operator is used to test for non-empty values (`NOT NULL` values)**.

The following SQL **lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field**:

```sql
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;
```

# 8. SQL `UPDATE` Statement

**The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.**

## `UPDATE` Syntax

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

`Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!`

## `UPDATE` Table

The following SQL statement **updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city**.

```sql
Get your own SQL Server
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

## `UPDATE` Multiple Records

It is the `WHERE` clause that determines how many records will be updated.

The following SQL statement **will update the ContactName to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico"**:

```sql
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan'
WHERE Country='Mexico';
```

## Update Warning!

`Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!`

```sql
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan';
```

`WARNING: Now every ContactName on every ROW is Juan (!)`

# 8. SQL `DELETE` Statement

**The `DELETE` statement is used to delete existing records in a table.**

## `DELETE` Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

`Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!`

## SQL `DELETE` Example

The following SQL statement **deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table**:

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
```

## `DELETE` All Records

**It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact**:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```

## `DELETE` All Records Example

The following SQL statement **deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table**:

```sql
DELETE FROM Customers;
```

# 9. SQL `TOP`, `LIMIT`, `FETCH FIRST` or `ROWNUM` Clause

## The SQL `SELECT TOP` Clause

**The `SELECT TOP` clause is used to specify the number of records to return.**

**The `SELECT TOP` clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.**

Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. **MySQL/Postgres supports the `LIMIT` clause to select a limited number of records**, while Oracle uses `FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY` and `ROWNUM`.

## Postgres `LIMIT` Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;
```

## Postgres `LIMIT` Example

The following SQL statement **selects the first three records from the "Customers" table** (for Postgres):

```sql
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;
```

## Add A `WHERE` Clause

The following SQL statement **selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany"** (for Postgres):

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;
```

# 10. SQL `MIN()` and `MAX()` Functions

**The `MIN()` function returns the smallest value of the selected column.**

**The `MAX()` function returns the largest value of the selected column.**

## `MIN()` Syntax

```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## `MAX()` Syntax

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## `MIN()` Example

The following SQL statement **finds the price of the cheapest product**:

```sql
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
FROM Products;
```

## `MAX()` Example

The following SQL statement **finds the price of the most expensive product**:

```sql
SELECT MAX(Price) AS LargestPrice
FROM Products;
```

# 11. SQL `COUNT()`, `AVG()` and `SUM()` Functions

**The `COUNT()` function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.**

## `COUNT()` Syntax

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**The `AVG()` function returns tthe average value of a numeric column.**

## `AVG()` Syntax

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**The `SUM()` function returns the total sum of a numeric column.**

## `SUM()` Syntax

```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## `COUNT()` Example

The following SQL statement **finds the number of products**:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
FROM Products;
```

## `AVG()` Example

The following SQL statement **finds the average price of all products**:
`Note: NULL values are ignored.`

```sql
SELECT AVG(Price)
FROM Products;
```

## `SUM()` Example

The following SQL statement **finds the number of products**:
`Note: NULL values are ignored.`

```sql
SELECT SUM(Quantity)
FROM OrderDetails;
```
